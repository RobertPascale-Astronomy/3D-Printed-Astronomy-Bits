# 3D Printed Astronomy Bits
 Items that I've Designed / modified for use with my Telescope gear

This is as much a repository for my own reference as it is for others to find useful.

I will typically also upload these to Thingiverse as well.
My Account there is: https://www.thingiverse.com/turbopascale/designs


Any items that have an MCX file were created with the MatterHackers Matter Control software.
Unless you intend to want to go through the underlying objects, it will just be as easy to use the STL file to print.

Sky Watcher Star Adventurer Front Altitude Knob
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4400964
The front altitude adjustment knob was missing on the unit I purchased secondhand.
Print this with thick sidewalls and high infill percentage.
NOTE: This needs modification - the shaft needs to be 3mm thick otherwise it can't get past the base. Files need to be modified.


Silicone Gasket mold for 5" Camera Dome
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4401362
Slice this in to quarters. Then printed 2 at a time.
Glue them together. Fill with silicon, scrape flat. Done!
